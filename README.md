# Direct-Booking-Summit
I developed and launched the website for the Direct Booking Summit, a premier event for hoteliers focused on increasing direct bookings. The site features a comprehensive agenda, speaker lineup, and details on past events. Key functionalities include event registration, sponsorship information, and networking opportunities. The design ensures a smooth user experience with clear navigation and vibrant visuals, effectively promoting the summit's offerings and engaging the target audience.
